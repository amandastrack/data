He came to us when he was doing a search for reputation management online.Has been with Reputology however because of losing yelp reviews as of February 1 needed to find a new provider. He is vetting other providers although at the end of the call he told me he is leaning towards Chatmeter because he loved our platform and enjoyed the presentation. HereHe uses a product called simply measured to measureFacebook activity like posts and lakes and also other analytics and he thinks he can replace simply measured by our platform and the analytics we are pulling in. They have 55 locations and will probably out on more locations this year to get up too to closer to hundred. Looking to make a decision in the next couple of weeks.

Brightwistle health got taken over by Influence Health

Influence health has their CRM

Stand - alone buildings in 60 locations 
Not much changes

Physical data - Hundreds of physicians
No way to keep them manually updated.

Script it out of their database and kept to their form field names.

Our template had more field

Tun script from them their side to a .CSV file and WE would do a delta.

Influence Health acquisition - They have a direct VPN to their database and ran with it.

Now where is he going to get data.

Influence Health still has the CMS. They will construct URL for the doctor directory.

CSV file that would come to us,
How do we determine which ones are new and which ones left..

Original CSV file had out SQL broke when the database changed.

Has no SQL script =. Has nothing.

If there’s an API opportunity, to run and get the info to our end.

Add locations, and parameters, and dictate what to add and what to remove. 

We can program into any API’s PH would have.

He would have to go to a vendor that holds their data so they can get API development done. 

Work with our API and perimeter into it.

He would have to pay someone to get the data out.

He would rather have API that would be something non-manual.

>> WE could put together some documentation about the process, give it to them, and they could find out what it would cost for their vendor to build an API.

Eric said the documentation would help.

API - his data source - same company - moving into a more robust system. 

Influence Health does not have API’s.

>> Paul said - shoot them an email, ask for weekly exports from them for now, to get started….A CSV export of their raw data.
Based on flags he has flagged, that will let us know what has changed, what has not… etc…

Get his raw data.  A single excel doc with a single row that has all the data that we need (Our Template)

Xander - Get the hours format 

Needs the hours format from us.
And see on his side who can “script” this for us."

- Kelly Ahern handles online reputation & social media efforts

- ""Catherine"" was the previous employee that handles digital efforts and is no longer with the company

- Catherine signed up with ReviewTrackers (reputation management) & ""Sim Partners"" for listing management

- This opportunity is scalable from 88 locations that they are currently monitoring to 400-500 if they add in each individual doctor/physician

- Reputation, social media, and local SEO are huge focuses for the company right now

- Their current contract is set to expire in winter/spring

- They signed up with Sim Partners and Review Trackers in March of 2016

- Their listings are a mess

- Kelly had plans to use positive reviews to share on social media so she loved the share feature in the reviews tab

- They are posting regularly on social media

**Next step** 

Meet with Mike and Kelly on November 3rd to further review the platform, left off on the listings tab. Need to show them rankings, workflow, and ReviewBuilder. Plan budget and deployment plan

Concerned about the transition from one vendor to another however I eased their concerns. This seems like this will be the biggest objection however with strategic salesmanship we can win this deal over.

**UPDATE**

Call on 11/4/16 I've identified all of the deal dynamics to move this forward. See call log notes and below.

**** Contract with ReviewTrackers and Sim Partners end Mid December ****

ReviewTrackers charged them $20 per location per month for Review management and Sim Partners tacked on listings for $75 per location.

They originally were going to roll out a pilot with whatever vendor they decided on for 88 corporate locations to start then 300-400 physicians/individual practices within 4-6 weeks. I let them know that they would get a much better rate if they did it all at once and everything was on one contract while also receiving a much better rate.

Pat is the VP of Marketing and Business development and he owns the budget.

It boils down between us and their current vendor who is doing an awful job. They had concerns of switching to a new vendor however I feel like enough urgency was created and value was built to nudge them to make a change.

They have a meeting to discuss who will be monitoring and responding to the individual physicians/practices on November 14th which we should have a total number of locations by that date.

There are very few channels to go through to move this deal forward. Kelly and Mike go right to Pat, Pat owns the budget and signs off on the deal. 

For the onboarding process Kelly would like advice on what will maximize local SEO value when they are building the CSV/Excel file for all of their locations - I told her I would be more than happy to coach her."

She quickly went to the GMP page and saw they had a handful of reviews in the past month. Told her I'd check that is not normal.  Other than that, they were impressed with PULSE and Rankings.

-  Birdeye promised them that they would add ANY review directory they requested, regardless of the size.  Examples specifically mentioned were:  Caring.com, A Place for Mom, Our Parents, SeniorLiving.org, Senior Advisor.  This appears to be the biggest part of their decision criteria, and they felt that we didn't care enough about what was important to them to agree to add these smaller review sites.

- All of their pharmacys are located directly within the healthcare provider facilities. In order to use these pharmacies it is required that you receive your treatment from the doctors/facilities that they are located in.

- They have very little focus on SEO and digital marketing. They focus more on traditional marketing like direct mailers, phone calls, etc.

- They are only on LinkedIn for social media and do not have any emphasis on FaceBook, no listings are created for these pharmacies since they are located in the treatment centers.

- Heidi sees opportunity by having listings created on Yelp, Google, etc. but she needs to check with legal to see if this is something that they are even permitted to do.

- The way that brand management tools would be a fit is by driving more patients to their treatment centers as they usually gain business after patients visit with prescribed medications.

- I asked if they would consider using marketing budget to help the hospitals with their listings/reputation for the sheer fact that it would help increase traffic which would increase pharmaceutical sales.

- Their most commonly visited site is their store locator page which is on their website.

- Heidi will need to check with the Director of Operations, sales team, and legal to see if they can use their budget to help these hospitals increase traffic."

The call was a little painful as he had no insight into their GMB/FB listings and reviews.  He though he had insight but was incorrect.  Their marketing dept is very fragmented and he said all the reviews and responses are handled by Communications.  I pointed out there is not much communicating going on since there are virtually no replies - even on FB where he said there are responses.  He needs to get me to that team.  and also we need to find out who takes care of listings because he was saying thing like he doesn't want more listings. (huh?!).  So it's a good opp - we need to get to right folks.

Rep.com dropping the ball on responses (one got a duplicate response a month later) and the reviews not coming in chronologically.  Told her our Google/FB API will b ready in 4 weeks.  They'll be onboarding 60 CHS Health July 1 and rolling out to rest of Pinnacle from July - Sept.  Final number of locs will be close to 300.

5-24 Great Third Meeting with Ashlee - Looking more like they're going to choose us.  Using Rep.Com and Meltwater Engage right now.  Also vetting Influence Health.  They are very bummed with Rep.com service - not pulling in reviews and missing posts they're making.  Also Listings look like crap.  We need to have ""instant"" Facebook alerts for Reviews, Responses, Instant Messages on FB and Reviews on Google.  Lee was on the call and we indicated we will have that in a month.  Wants to also onboard a hospital system they're acquiring: CHS Hospitals (Carlysle).  Next step we do an audit for 10 locs.  Ashlee is sending the locations to run the audit for that and scheduling a follow up call to go through those listings and reviews (they are currently using a provider but she did not know)..

3-27 . 300 locs total with doctors.  120 total locations + providers.  Uses Rep.com. Said that they also ""claim all their FB/Google listings and others.  Unhappy with them as lots is falling through the cracks.  Wanted to know if we can claim Yelp pages (said yes) and if Chatmeter is mobile friendly and can be set up to get an alert everytime someone leaves a review.  Sending pricing and screenshots. Follow up within a week.  Needs to present to her boss and see if they can get our of Rep. com (contract is through October)."

7/1/17 Tremaine is the Reputation Digital Manager. Just signed another year contract with Rep.com. Generating reviews, doing surveys is huge for him! It is a very manual and laborious process right now. Did not seem to have an issue with HIPAA. They want to generate more Goole and FB reviews so he loved Review Builder. Listings is not his area but will make an intro to that person - although he knows that they have a contract with their agency for that.. He wants RB pricing only for now and the CM + LLM for future rollouts. $35 for bot. $19 for LLM"

Our team here to talk about listings and help give advice. Yext had repeated dropped the ball on service support with them and their listings were in terrible shape. 

Used our listings collateral and Chatmeter vs. Yext deck to speak to problems with syndication and suppression with Yest. 
Also, we ran out of Starbucks coffee cards, so I used sendoso to send Robin a gift card right after the conference to get back on the line. And keep our momentum going.

Entire LIFECYCLE: Jonathan started reaching out to Jerard Phillips Cate and Hancock back in April for a HMPS in Utah in 2018. They are a healthcare marketing agency and I finally met with them in May 2018. We continued to stay in touch and had a follow up meeting in July where they told me that they are looking at Chatmeter for one of their clients Mount Nittany Health.   
I knew they were pitching that healthcare system and they were selling them on using a platform that is calculating all time star ratings and reviews. Had a couple of followup meetings - They then went dark in the November timeframe. 
January 2019 - Kira from Mount Nittany reached out to me to ask to get a demo of Chatmeter for her and for her coworkers. I pitched them in January 2019 and sent over all of the follow ups. They said they had to make sure they had budget for it and finally in March they said they were going to move forward. I sent them the service agreement in March where it took over two months for it to go through internal executive meetings, approvals & more meetings. 
Throughout all this I consistently stayed on top of Kira to ensure that this continues to move forward and finally closed end of May.
