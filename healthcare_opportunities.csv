April 29th

How they heard about us

Number of pitches throughout sales cycle
1 - Pitch as a refresher

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker
Digital Strategic Marketing Manager
Signer was COO, but we didn't need to meet him. He just signs big agreements. 

Favorite Chatmeter products
All in one dash for rep management and listings are WAY better than Rep.com

State if the contact ever went dark, how long, and how they came back (BDR got them back on, requested a demo)
Never went dark

Any marketing content downloads (case study, downloads, webinars, etc.)
Web form filled out on 4/29 and then registered for webinar, Uncovering Patient Experience Blind Spot Webinar - May 2019

Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close 
Tracy and Ally were on a call to start the conversation around what we need from her for their listings to make the transition smooth. 

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract
Yes, their legal took forever. They pushed back on the auto-renewal stopping it at 3 years. Then it was a week process for every little adjustment. 

Length of sales cycle
About 2 months

Competitors won against

Entire LIFECYCLE: Jonathan started reaching out to Jerard Phillips Cate and Hancock back in April for a HMPS in Utah in 2018. They are a healthcare marketing agency and I finally met with them in May 2018. We continued to stay in touch and had a follow up meeting in July where they told me that they are looking at Chatmeter for one of their clients Mount Nittany Health.   
I knew they were pitching that healthcare system and they were selling them on using a platform that is calculating all time star ratings and reviews. Had a couple of followup meetings - They then went dark in the November timeframe. 
January 2019 - Kira from Mount Nittany reached out to me to ask to get a demo of Chatmeter for her and for her coworkers. I pitched them in January 2019 and sent over all of the follow ups. They said they had to make sure they had budget for it and finally in March they said they were going to move forward. I sent them the service agreement in March where it took over two months for it to go through internal executive meetings, approvals & more meetings. 
Throughout all this I consistently stayed on top of Kira to ensure that this continues to move forward and finally closed end of May.
