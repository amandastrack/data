I hope your doing good. I’m sorry for the delay, rest assured Chatmeter is still in our plans. If we are to move forward it won’t be before May because we have a lot of projects going on right now and we need more time to put everything in place. I didn’t have time to contact Mrs Costei yet, but should be done shortly.

Thanks a lot for your follow up. I will contact you if I need more information.


3-21  Spoke with Veronique - Valerie Harkins' project now.  Looking at another referral  Great idea to show the dashboard to the team.  Valerie is sick -  Call back tomorrow.  Going forward in May. - (450) 435-2426

2-26 Sent them 2 Canadian referrals.  They are calling them in a few days.

Great call with Veronique and Valerie. 128 locations throughout Canada.  Local SEO Search has become a much more important topic for them recently.  They need to sell this internally and asked specifically how much more this matters than Google Ad Words.  They need to create a budget and think they can move on this in the next 3-4 months.. Definitely will want Listings Management"

When Neil called….
Reviews (Solicit, Respond), Listings Management
•	Team, roles, time spent?
•	Tools use, used, seen, heard of?
Most important to you?


Heard of chatmeter before…in order to monitor online review
Used to use a similar tool for 5 months.  About 5 years ago.  Did some Instagram tags with old tool.  Couldn’t remember anything else.  

A little responding of reviews…not really 
Contact Us page for internal survey for complaints

No one is really doing anything.  
Very few reviews: 10 in the last 6 months.  Competitors are beating them with twice as many.  Huge opportunity to crush them.  
Listings are terrible.  
Working on getting money for new website.  
Budget/Fisal year is October 31st.  
Asked for a call back in December.  
Took the call b/c he was serious about moving into the digital age.  Likes what we do. Recognizes the real value.  
Priority 1 is new website and getting money for it.  


His boss is VP Mkg.  No one else.  No one is handling what we do.  They really are flying blind or have their heads in the sand."

They currently have over 800 locations in the world
200 corporate owned in the US
200 franchised
400 are international franchises

They are testing a pilot brand called Fast Casual which is a different style of pizza that they would like to also include as well (Kitchen Cucinova)

The budget that will be used is for 2017 however he will use partial budget from 2016 to cover the first initial deployment

Matt wants to roll out this solution to the 200 corporate owned stores first as a pilot before they roll this out to the franchisees

He has already looked at MomentFeed & Yext

I had him agree that if we were to get our platform at the price he needed it to be at that he would move this deal forward mid November because he liked us the best (Shane)

He was transparent and said that his budget was allocated and he needs to be at around $150 per location per year with listing management in order to go with us (Shane)

They have an extremely fragmented system for all of their online review management and they are seriously looking at options now to move forward in November (Shane)

Currently they are using Hootsuite and another review generating tool - however it is not as good as ours (Shane)

SUSIE'S NOTES:  

2-17-17 -  I just gave him a price of $19 per loc for CM and LLM -  Lock for Life.  February close and use them as reference client.   BEST AND FINAL.  I think we're up against Sprinklr or BirdEye -  He won't tell me who, but says their a Certified Yelp Partner.  

Old info:
I have given him a price of $23 per location for CM and LLM plus Price Lock for Life -  Contingent upon closing in February and that we can use them as a reference client."

Panera has claimed all the Unclaimed FB Pages. To move forward, he wants us to 1. Identify the misses 2. Identify the opportunities. 3. Be specific about they need our services. How will it be utilized? How will this increase their sales? Ex. You follow through with this - this is how your revenue increases. etc. Follow up with him after Thanksgiving. Jan/Feb 2017 purchase.

1-23 . Email from JJ: Thank you for your patience on this matter! After discussing with our team, we love the platform, however while you are offering a great price at $10 per cafe, adding another $1000 to our budget is not something we feel comfortable doing at this time. That being said it may be something we might be interested in as we continue to grow. Would you be able to reach out to me around early Q3?"

They are currently in 48 markets through 3 different brands. Federated Media, Media General, and LIN Media

LIN Media works with local customers - they work with clients mainly in healthcare, retail, auto dealers, and some universities; Target is one of their clients

They currently offer an SEO package with written content available, business listings, and plan to get more involved with social media once they merge with Nextstar

Nextstar does a lot in the reputation management/social media space

She will be sending over a sample client for a proposal.

** 2nd meeting with Sarah - Director of Search and Social notes below **

Matthew & Rocky were also on the call (Matthew is the SEO Supervisor)

The pain points they have experienced with Yext is a lack of reporting and their dashboard is unresponsive at times

Their looking to select a vendor this month to kick off with a new vendor Jan 1

**12/14/16** TT Sarah on requirements call

Talked to Sarah today and discovered that they are looking at SweetIQ, Yext, and us. She initially said we all look like we do the same thing and I clearly proved that were different.

The important pieces for her were to make sure that all local listings were monitored and managed without much effort on their end.

We covered the listing inaccuracy report in greater detail, the integrated rank tracker, reviewbuilder, facebook duplicate suppression & parent child relationship. These were all value adds that they would reap benefit from.

Sending over the contract in PDF format for their legal team to review"

So far so good.  They had access for a few days and had some follow up Q's.  Introduced to one more person on their team.  We have to do a lot better with pricing.  Currently using MOZ and Rep.com.   Looping back later next week to get an idea of where we need to be.  Will onboard all 285 properties at once.  This is a ""fall"" deal.

6-21-17 Met with Kristen Miller (Marketing Director) and Kyra Lambo (Digital Marketing Manager).  Over 250 properties.  They've been with rep.com for a couple of years and say it serves them 90% of what they need.  Using MOZ for LLM.  Rep.com contract up for renewal in Sept.   They want to be able to export lots of reports to the field.  They liked the platform (said a bit more user friendly than rep.com) and rep.com has lots of bells and whistles they can't use.  Stressed the Yelp relationship.   Need listings management.  F/U in 2 weeks and send over deck.  And pricing.  Wanted to make sure we push via API for listings.

Met w/Kristen.  Showed her PULSE and Chatter.  Although she was more interested in Reviews and slicing that information and reporting.  Very big into reporting - that's how they would utilize our data.  Using Rep.com and Moz. Said they're pretty happy with it - I showed her the listings data we gathered and the mess there.  Her interest was definitely peaked re: listings. Not her area. Although she was surprised it was so bad.  Hit upon the competitive benchmarking, and Rankings . Would not tell me how much they pay - ahtough she commented we are competitive when bundling CM and LLM.  Follow up later this week for a meeting and get her LM person on.  Rep .com contract ends in September."

No time to handle all.  They then pass along any issues to AZ customer service.   Biggest issue is how do we deal with all the local pages and issues on the local level.  Asked how do we start and how do we operationalize it?  Called it a social CRM play.   Saw it as a great platform to mine data and solve problems.  Mentioned interest in ChatExec and asked how they set that up.  Would like to do reporting like:  Team has engaged in 1000 customer complaints. We were able to solve X amount.etc.. They saw our platform as fully comprehensive and robust.  Said AutoZone is very nitpicky and cost conscious.    Makes sense for them to be on the call with me and Alejandra on Monday.

Already work with a company (did not tell me whom) that hosts their individual pages, made store locator pages, updates their listings and brings in ""some"" reviews - Google and Yelp.  All in all it was a great call with Dylana.  Said this was very timely as they've been having lots of internal discussions recently about being more customer focused , as the supermarket industry is getting more and more competitive with each other and online.  Loved the dashboard and saw lots of value in it.  Just wants to be sure their efforts are not being duplicated.  Their contract with this other company is 2 years and locked in through March 2018. Admitted our dashboard looks like it is 10X easier to use.  has to convince boss about this extra expenditure.

They use Yext and partnered with them a little over a year ago although he said they do just their Google my business pages. Also just met with Yelp last week to talk about claiming their Yelp pages.  Told him that's perfect cause we can then clean up Yelp listings. Went through the deck and briefed him on what we mean by local SCO because he thought it was local pages.  He asked questions about reviews and review management and how our large retail customers handdle those.  Also asked if we'd be a replacement for or work side by side with Yext.  As he's new, he's platform agnostic.  Wanted all followups and case studies.  Of course needs to consult with teams.  He's looking to make a decision in Jan as fiscal year starts in February.

    After some discussion with my superiors we have decided not to use Chatmeter this year. I thank you for all of the hard work and concessions you've made on our behalf and I hate that we will not be using your services this year. I hold out hope that there will be a time in the future when you can aid us in our business.
 
Kindest Regards
 
Chad M. Iden 

4-20-17  Second meeting with Chad - Really trying to sell him on the benefit of having CM and LLM for a year.  They are a tax prep office, seasonal business.  Having a hard time selling internally - bc they normally do only 6 month contracts.  Sending him lots more backups screenshots and LCV information.

Great meeting w/. Chad - 100 locs total (Tax preparation services) he manages 88 offices.  Set up meeting with him after I approached him at SMMW.  He was very receptive to meeting as he was asking about how to increase # of reviews.  He handles it all!  Social media (mainly), GMB listings, FB pages, Yelp enterprise account.  Saw LOTS of value in CM - loved RB. Desperately needs LLM, as many of their offices don't even have a listing.  Sending over pricing - asked for a 6 month term since they're seasonal.. Quoted $32 all in (CM_ELLM)"

She wanted to know if you would manage their listings for them and I told her that would be an additional cost. Didn’t seem she was going to go with that since she was very price sensitive to the platform alone.

Franchisees pay into Marketing budget each year.

Some of the locations use Synup to manage their reviews and listings.   This is clearly a mess.  Synup is an Indian company, and we think they re-type all of the listings one by one... judging on the errors and inaccuracies. 

Some of the locations are brick and morter... but many of them are just service providers who work out of their homes.  Don't want to list their addresses, just phone numbers and PO Boxes. 

They have a lot of DEAD listings that they'd like to clean up, but there is no way to claim a listing and kill it if it is a defunct business or if there was not a brick and morter store attached to it to begin with .  Can we give him best practices around how to do that?

- All of their pharmacys are located directly within the healthcare provider facilities. In order to use these pharmacies it is required that you receive your treatment from the doctors/facilities that they are located in.

- They have very little focus on SEO and digital marketing. They focus more on traditional marketing like direct mailers, phone calls, etc.

- They are only on LinkedIn for social media and do not have any emphasis on FaceBook, no listings are created for these pharmacies since they are located in the treatment centers.

- Heidi sees opportunity by having listings created on Yelp, Google, etc. but she needs to check with legal to see if this is something that they are even permitted to do.

- The way that brand management tools would be a fit is by driving more patients to their treatment centers as they usually gain business after patients visit with prescribed medications.

- I asked if they would consider using marketing budget to help the hospitals with their listings/reputation for the sheer fact that it would help increase traffic which would increase pharmaceutical sales.

- Their most commonly visited site is their store locator page which is on their website.

I just don’t have the bandwidth to drive this.

I assume this should reside within the Care organization, but currently they are not staffed to support a program of this scale.

OTHER NOTES: 
Cox is struggling internally to figure out how to use and pay for Chatmeter.  This is not a new discussion for them, but one that they have had before.  They are very fragmented with lots of departments that could/should use CM

Kitty says she has stirred up quite a discussion.  She is going to have to fight for us internally, but will have her work cut out.  I offered second demo or other support.  Stay in touch with her, but no fast sale

Says pain points are: 
Notifications of reviews/social coming in 
PM’s have seen/heard of chatmeter and asked for us to FU and Jeff has been all over them.  


No date from mgmt. to make an official decision BUT she is taking the time to see all options and would like to get this done asap."

Examples specifically mentioned were:  Caring.com, A Place for Mom, Our Parents, SeniorLiving.org, Senior Advisor.

Hi Tania,
 
Very generous offer, but we’re just not in a position to pull the trigger right now.  Appreciate the work on our behalf and I hope we can revive the offer when we are ready to move.
Thanks,
Alison Glenn Delaney| Chief Marketing Officer

Call - Met with Tamika again - Went through Review Builder and store comparison.  She said right now the priority is Revamping Menu, Cust Loyalty, SMS, Online ordering.
She is gathering all data for Alison - They will be hitting the road in a week for the menu revamp effort.  Told me right now all our dashboard offers is exactly what they're looking for.  We do ""what they want us to do"".  Asked for ROI study and pricing. Said she'll get back to me.  Told her I'll stay in front of her and follow up in Nov. Said that was fine

1-18-17 . Met with Alison (CMO) and Tamika.  They liked the ""really cool dashboard"" and that we assign account managers.  They are working with Yext for Listings Management.  Alison's big question was about Chatter.  Wanted to know WHERE the social media mentions are coming from, in terms of buckets (like we have in reviews).  Said it looked like it's easy to use.  Quoted rate card price and she stated with the Huddle House Average Unit Volume being 1/3 to 1/2 less than competition, it doesn't make sense she's being charged the same as a Friday's, per se.    BECAUSE they're already using Yext, I said I'm going to bat for them.. Wanted Screenshots and Login credentials.  Follow up in 2 weeks.. They want to make decision in 4-6 weeeks."

**Update 08/16 from Shane's convo with Matt**

TT Matt today - they still want to move forward but they need to hire a marketing rep to manage it. He has someone interviewing tomorrow 8/16. Call in September as I told him prices will be increasing in October. I told him it would take a few weeks to set everything up so it would be best to finalize a contract in October. Matt is the business development manager and oversees this, but wouldn't have to much hands on so its not a huge priority to finalize at this time.

*****UPDATE******

9/1 TT Tim in OPS. Let him know about our new partnership with Yelp and the price increase on 10/1, They are 30-45 days out to onboarding their new digital marketing person.

**Talked to Matt on 9/6 - they are non committal at this point. They need to set up another demo towards the end of October/November. Call around that time to set up another meeting with all the DM's in one room**

**12/19**

Demo with Matt & York

License model - similar to Golf HQ
Licensees pay a deposit of 4K to enroll
Peachwave makes their money through selling the peachwave yogurt product and syrups

Loved the competitor benchmarking

Discovered the cofounder/owners name is Boyd. He LOVES the high level analytical data, reporting, etc that chatmeter offers. They want to get on a call with all of us to set up the next moves.

I blew their MINDS with the FaceBook story. The big ""ah-ha"" moment that caught their attention was how we can help claim their facebook pages and set up a parent child relationship for their mess of duplicates and unofficial pages

Corporate control of social media is something they have always had interest in

They are also interested in traditional organic SEO so I am looping in Dorian to get his expertise and insight, maybe a collaborative offering?

1-16 Following up with Matt - He is working with Dorian on SEO.  York is the main POC for them.   Check back in 3 months."

Currently they are using RIO SEO and have been looking to make a change; the contract is set to end in May of next year

They currently do not have a system in place for managing reviews and it has not been a priority according to Jodie due to the fact that ""reviews are reliant on customers and they cannot control them"".

I showed her ReviewBuilder and blew her mind.

Another issue with RIO SEO is the fact that they do not have any sort of competitor data or benchmarking built into the platform

They are currently using HootSuite

The buying process is somewhat complicated as they are owned by Kroger and most decisions for software purchases have to be approved by their team/board.

Jodie has time carved out the week of 9/19 to meet with the DM's at the parent company to discuss our platform. Kroger is currently looking at several SEO solutions and she is concerned that they will adopt a tool and force them to use the same solution. I recommended that she identify who is leading that project internally so that we can coordinate a meeting with all of the appropriate decision makers."

I dont believe we will be needing this meeting.
I just heard back on the budget after pushing them a few more times. This program did not make it into the 2017 budget.

Best to follow up in January of 2018 to see if we can add this in for that budget year.

best,
Zachary



May 1 Follow- Up Meeting - Follow up meeting with Zachary to show him PULSE and latest Listings info. Budget decision is THIS week! Looking at us and Vendasta - said they're cheaper based on store count. Sentiment AND LLM are top priorities. Needs to see a larger audit cause 10 stores not compelling enough to sell on the Value Prop. Needs HARD DATA to provide a business case - not just about making his life easier. Already sent over an .xcl with all locations.

I'VE LEARNED WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST VENDASTA AND A SMALL, NO-NAME VENDOR.  I WAS ABLE TO FILL IN THE DETAILS ABOUT PARTNERSHIP WITH YELP AND INTRODUCED OUR NEW RB MODULE TODAY.  I ASKED FOR HIS BUSINESS IN SEPTEMBER TO LOCK IN PRICES BEFORE INCREASE.  HE SHOULD HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR ME 9/19 OR 9/20.  TS

I nailed the demo, but the information in the audit did not appear to have been refreshed... making that part somewhat clunky. I have asked audits team to re-run it again and let me know what they (see below) - 

Audits team re-ran audit... same results.  Really bad rankings across the board on local and organic.  We think that the keywords we used for this audit may be too broad and have returned unrealistic representation of this client's real rankings.  

I have reached out to Client to ask them to review the keywords we've used and to provide us with a different set of keywords and we will re-run it and send him screen shots of new audit results. 

INFO GATHERED DURING DEMO:
find. I will send updated screen captures as part of my normal demo followup once I hear back from Audits.

NOTES: They have 74 stores, US CAN UK SCAN and ASIA - Not interested in monitoring the Asian or Scandanavian locations. 

No review monitoring right now, but this is a priority for them
They get most of their reviews on Foursquare, Instagram, FB, Yelp and G+
They own their Yelp profiles - 
They do not garner reviews in any formal fashion
They have Regional managers and Operational managers"

Reputation is on the front burner for them.  Thought Chatmeter is a better tool for Reputation management.  Love the alerts and how everything rolls up on the dashboard.
Use call tracking Numbers and were afraid they'd ""break things"" if they fixed listings.
Questions they had and answers:
Q. Why are some of the listing sites creating duplicates?
A. Many listing sites collect listing data from aggregators (Axciom, Factual and others).  When a new telephone # or new address is created, and Google finds it (it's always scraping for info) then picked up by Bing, then aggregators also source the new info, virtually a new listing has come into existence, then you get other listing sites like Yellowpages, Yelp and others creating a new listing.

Q. In our Listings tab, why does it say ""no picture available"" for Apartment Ratings?
A. Spoke with the development team about that, and it's because on that site, as well as on SuperPages, there is no ""primary photo"" preference.  On Yelp, there is, and we pull that in.  
     That's an easy fix.  We can go in and just select a photo on that site to pull in to populate that thumbnail.

Q.  Why does it show, on our Listings Tab, for Mission Capital Crossing there are 76 images on Apartments and for Priest Lake there are 53 images on Apartments?
A.  Chatmeter pulls in these images from those sites, regardless of who published them.  On Apartments, these images are posted.  I took a couple of screen shots to show you below:

These ""franchisees"" are referred to as members.

Pitched to Lee Clapp who is the Executive Director - he is the ultimate gatekeeper and coach for the members to recommend new solutions/tools to improve the way they conduct business.

There are a total of 46 members and 73 stores - they are interested in listing management.

Each member owns their own e commerce site and that has been a focus; Lee agreed that bolstering SEO and increasing reviews would add significant value to their e commerce strategy.

On average a customer will spend $60-$70 in one visit.

Lee was blown away when I shared the FaceBook story with him and LOVED the store by store comparison in our scoring report.

The big AHAH moment which we will continue to poke is the fact that the store that produced the highest revenue was also the highest scored location in our platform. 

He said that this budget was ""peanuts"".

Invited us to present this to all 46 members to collectively gain buy-in at their annual conference which takes place 9/26 in Tucson. He also had mentioned that there will be MANY other golf brands and storefronts there that would be a great introduction if we were to set up a booth. Normally their booth costs are $2500, Lee said he would be happy to offer us a booth for $500 if we wanted to participate.


**OCTOBER UPDATE**

Ran two presentations with a total of 16 members on both calls, there are 47 members total equalling 83 stores. I recorded the pitch and plan to send the recording to Lee Clapp and Joe Costa to share with the rest of the members. Collectively, everyone agreed that they would sign up so we are on pace to close this month.

**Pain point** - Bill Mitchell at Golf HQ in Montana said he had an SEO company trying to charge him $800/month just to clean up listings."

She said they have a relationship with Yelp and respond to reviews ""privately"" 
Admitted they have nothing formal  in place for reviews and listings. 
She also said they clean up Google listings themselves.   
They are trying to build more presence because most of what they do is business catering (although I saw they get lots of other foot traffic).  They are doing FB ads and have someone who works with their SEO.

Client basically thinks she knows everything about SEO and Local SEO (their results prove otherwise).  She didn't understand how this audit came about.  Didn't think any of our data was legitimate or accurate, despite me showing her exactly where the information was being pulled in from.  She has just picked two solutions for listing management (ModLocal) and someone else that is going to do review surveys.  She liked our Ranking tool, but not enough to consider CM for real.  Said to check with her next year to see if she how things are going with the solutions they've selected for now."

Wants to keep up on the latest and greatest - had never heard of us.
Wants Local SEO, Listings Management and Reputation Management for his clients.
Currently working with Vendasta.
Started with Yext 6 years ago - They outgrew them because Yext not as deep.
Used UBL - Listings Management
1/2 of customers are medium - large single unit (Attorneys, plumbers, HVAC folks)
1/2 are corporate franchise model - multi location restaurants, Yoga studios, golf ..
Uses New Brand Analytics for new clients - monitor restaurant outside review sources although too expensive for them.  
Listings are too manual for Vendasta.
He's trying to figure out how they can be more efficient.
Wanted to know - DO we have a relationship with the large database aggregators so we can push updates direct to databases?  (Vendasta will populate those - he mentioned).
9-14  Met with Klint with Collin.  Klint is one of the founding members.
Agency, using Vendasta for about 700 locations.  
He has a very cheap price.  Been using Vendasta for about 3 years.  Paying Vendasta only $14 per location per month for platform and to submit to 4 aggregators. He's used Yext and Moz before and feels that aggregators are good enough since his team will then manually claim and update Google and Bing.  
Vendasta does have listing sync, which does submit to 40 sites directly.  It's a 'much"" higher cost.   
Vendasta is monitoring Instagram, but they are not geotagged.  They are just using brand search.  Then the user can geotag it manually. 
RANKINGS, WORKFLOW and GEOSEARCH not in Vendasta.  
He really wants a review with mutliple Q's like a survey - his restaurant client ask for that all the time.  Collin said it's in the works.
Comes down to:  1. Is it something he wants to do?  2. How will he do it?  3. What does the transition look like?
9-22 Pushed out a scheduled call with Dorian and me to the first week of October."

I have a call scheduled on 9/29 with Jodie to learn who she has identified as the individual leading the project for Kroger; details below.

Jodie is the digital marketing director and her sole focus is improving local SEO - perfect contact for this pitch 

Currently they are using RIO SEO and have been looking to make a change; the contract is set to end in May of next year 

They currently do not have a system in place for managing reviews and it has not been a priority according to Jodie due to the fact that ""reviews are reliant on customers and they cannot control them"". 

I showed her ReviewBuilder and blew her mind. 

Another issue with RIO SEO is the fact that they do not have any sort of competitor data or benchmarking built into the platform 

They are currently using HootSuite 

The buying process is somewhat complicated as they are owned by Kroger and most decisions for software purchases have to be approved by their team/board. 

Jodie has time carved out the week of 9/19 to meet with the DM's at the parent company to discuss our platform. Kroger is currently looking at several SEO solutions and she is concerned that they will adopt a tool and force them to use the same solution. I recommended that she identify who is leading that project internally so that we can coordinate a meeting with all of the appropriate decision makers."

I originally met with them last year and presented the Buffalo Wild Wings audit to them.Most of the brands they work with do not have brick-and-mortar locations and what they really wanted to focus on was listing management because they don't work with reputation for their brands. They claim that they do all the listings on Google Facebook and Yelp for Buffalo wild wings which is surprising because he also said they don't use any tools they do it all manually. I quoted them for listings management only for 1000 locations of Buffalo wild wings. They said it would be a hard-sell because between all other marketing initiatives and paying for Yelp, Buffalo wild wings may not buy the listings management service through us although I know they are paying them for it sending over info and following up to dive deeper into this as we only had less than 30 minutes."

Their listings are a mess and he pointed out he knows that and they are in process of cleaning up those listings. He hired some third party he wouldn't say whom to clean up their listings. He has only been there three months now and is assessing what needs to be done and taking baby steps for everything including rebuilding their websites. So responding to reviews right now is not even on his radar. He did like the sentiment analysis and also the media images that we are pulling in. He is working on a very very limited marketing budget and needs to prioritize. Are a list pricing was basically his entire budget for the year he said. He wanted access to Chatmeter to see what he really actually needs an we can work from there."

Kristen was super nice and very open and receptive to everything on our dahsboard. She understands the whole review side and importance however did not know just how important listings were.  They have many GMB pages unclaimed and don’t have FB pages claimed.  That was an education for her and I was able to show her on my phone how the Google Maps search looks and how - if they don’t appear on the first “page” they will get passed up.  During the meeting she shared how her Trip Advisor person literally has to go to every hotel review page and search for any reviews that talk about “parking”.  She had a lightbulb moment that she can have all the hotels where they manage parking and Valet on the dashboard to pull in those reviews.  They are paying $25/month for Inrix - that is a service through Waze that plots their locations on a in-car nav system. I mentioned that many people don’t have those nav systems and the LOCAL SEO issue we solve helps with all those situations where people are using Google or Apple Maps to find parking.  Their business is 60% / 40% B2b and B2C which they call transient."

The cost per listing is key to being able to offer this service as we add new clients and locations. They're currently using Rep. com and were told by them that Yelp had recent ""API changes"" and because of that, they're no longer getting Yelp reviews. They're much more focused on Reputation and wanted to know how flexible we are and how simple it is to add on locations. They also wanted to be sure they can print numerous types of reports by location or by group. And what reports are automated..Talked to them about our minimum which they woul\d be at to start, and add more as they go.

He is vetting other providers although at the end of the call he told me he is leaning towards Chatmeter because he loved our platform and enjoyed the presentation. HereHe uses a product called simply measured to measureFacebook activity like posts and lakes and also other analytics and he thinks he can replace simply measured by our platform and the analytics we are pulling in. They have 55 locations and will probably out on more locations this year to get up too to closer to hundred. Looking to make a decision in the next couple of weeks."

Been looking at companies who provide a kiosk or ""tablet"" to have at each senior living facility.  She was most interested in accessing our social media tab.  And also stated her IT department insists on having outside tech be integrated with their software.  Doesn't sound like a great opp.  Told her we can def provide her social and their IT can integrate with our API.  She wants followup but tempered it with really leaning to the kiosk solution."

They use Sprout Social for their social and they do their listings and Google my business pages in house as well as respond to reviews in house.
She has seen the platform before about a year ago and it she liked it back again and she really likes it now it’s really becoming clear to her that she can do so much managing in one place and it’s also more clear that they do need to get something in place and make decisions on how they’re going to standardize the reputation and listings peace now that they’re going to grow so quickly this year I told her it’s best to get this in place so there ahead of the growth curve so they’re not trying to clean up messes after they’ve grown and she agreed with me.

Wants us to push different phone numbers to Google, FB and Yelp and all the others can be consistent.  Says that does not impact their SEO as much as it used to and he's fine with that.  Uses Dynamic Number Insertion on his web pages. He's been getting a range of $10-$17 for listings from these 3 competitors.  He wont go with our $2K Min + the insistence on pushing different phone #'s isn't in sync with what we do... Still open for discussion tho.


Safeguard has 70 locations and currently with Rep.com and has a ""sweetheart"" deal of $10/location.   They also talked to Brandify who said they can clean up their listings, get rid of duplicates, and do rep management for $14/location.  We were obviously way more than the two and he also wanted custom API link to their survey tool that Rep.com built for them.  Will send followups and pricing.  He asked a ton of Q's and was super knowldgeable."

Each franchisee is responsible for their own listings and Yelp.  He does not foresee the club owners actually responding to reviews although I challenged him on that.  Showed him how not having enough reviews is also hurting their Google and Yelp rankings.  He needs to sell this up and said he dreaded ""you may have to sell this to each individual location"".  Told him we would not do that and it's best to get buy in from most if not all so they can take advantage of the price discount. Wants all follow-ups and a call end of next week.  Nice guy.

They are a furniture and appliance store primarily in the south west south central and south east region in United States.I found out about them through my contact Jeff Semler who left Sonic and is now with Conn's. They have 117 locations.  They need a quick and efficient path to see and respond to reviews.  Using YEXT for over a year now and are pretty happy with them.  They also use Podium to solicit reviews although they are not happy with podium because it notifies them only if they have a low score. They realized on the call that their agency they hired to respond to reviews and escalate to them is not doing the job they were hired to do - Very disappointed about how many 1 star awful reviews they have not responded to -  They are meeting internally and discussing.  This is not necessarily in their budget but see a need and know they can justify if they don't use the agency...

3-14 . Met with John Thomas VP ecommerce and website and Chantel Greem SEO and Digital Manager.  The main focus for Conn's is reputation management and customer experience.  Presented mostly around the opportunity to respond to all reviews and get a grasp of operational feedback through sentiment.  This will go through Jeff Semler's team (whom I've presented to) and would be a Chatmeter only buy. Using Yext for listings and don't really want to change that."

Interestingly enough she also told me that Respage is still getting the Yelp reviews and they have a way where they are responding to Yelp reviews from their dashboard.  She knows the saga of yelp and Reputation management companies and even though she divulged some Respage info she didn't want to say much more.  Having Google schema working and set up would be crucial for them.  Talked about the possibility of triggering surveys Chatmeter after certain events like the maintenance or move out.

Met with Jessica and Hillary to go over Dashboard again and how they would add users. Discussed contract details.  Number of properties to onboard. Rollout process.  What we need from them.  Asked about live training.

6-12-17 3rd meeting with the broader team, Hillary, Amanda, Alanda  (rep management) and Jessica (Dir of Leasing).  Focus of this call was to focus on the Review Management.  Alanda is doing everything manually now so this is a HUGE time saver for her.  Wants to respond to Google and FB from the dashboard. Does not want to give access to all the property managers. Right now, each PM goes out to review sites, daily, and identifies the reviews needed to be responded to.  They write the response and email it to Elanda who then edits and responds.   Quoting 27+12 for 67 props.  Follow up on Friday June 16.  Want to turn this around sooner than later.  Hired a new SM person and another person for their dept. Both start this week.

6-1-17 Mostly Student Housing - 67 properties now and continuously acquiring more.  Each property manager is responsible for manually reporting on all the reviews for their property and any listings issues,  They admitted this is not ideal however that is the process today.  They are in need of Listings Management as well and were blown away by the ease of use of the dashboard and review monitoring.  We had only 30 min scheduled for the call so they want a revisit next week and pull in the Director of Leasing, the final decision maker.  They will send over more properties for the audit.  Right now using Hootsuite and Sprout Social for their social.  Going over Chatter, Pulse and RB on next call.

Hi Randall- We currently use a mix of tools for SM and online monitoring, which is obviously not ideal and something we’re looking to streamline asap. Because we’ve acquired from different companies some are on Sprout Social, Hootsuite, and Mention. I also use social mention, google alerts and a few other one-off tools to help track activity. Again, it’s not the most efficient method by any means.
 
About how many properties are you looking for? I can definitely send you a list of some we’d like to focus on."

Met w/ Alice - Their brand is CashLand OK (oklahoma) and I noticed as soon as we got on we had locations in IN and OH.  She let me know right off the bat their brand spit up and Cashland in those northern states is called Cash America although still carry the Cashland name.  We went through the demo anyway - walked her through the slides and quickly touched on most tabs in the dashboard.  Turns out they have only 15 locations.  She wants to see the audit for her actual stores> quoted our min pricing - she said she sees lots of value in our platform, because Lots of reviews left on their sites are actually reviews from the locations in the north (IN and OH) that they're not associated with.

Knows Sprinklr bought them. and Sprinklr is sunseting NBA in 2018. However, Sprinklr is moving NBA clients to their review management platform. He as very concerned about our Yelp partnership bc NBA stopped pulling in Yelp reviews and was in a lawsuit with them. He has a bad taste in his mouth from this and asked me three times if I'm sure we are Yelp partners and are pulling in reviews. They're exploring other vendors as they continue improvement processes. They want the ability to respond to reviews so field can followup. He wants to be able to keep his finger on the pulse of his business. His main focus is to ""pick a vendor that can do what they need them to do"". He liked what he saw. LOVED Compet Analysis (wants to put in there Auntie Anne's) and Reviews flexibilty and reporting. He said the presentation was very forthcoming and refreshing as it was all about him! And not about our product. He also thought it was refreshing to talk to a software company that actually shared pricing with him! Needs to present to CMO since lots falls in her area."

So we ended up doing most the demo, which went very well.  They LOVED the platform, were surprised to see so much they were totally unaware of.

She's now strictly in marketing, when before she was handling way too much. She has focused on claiming all their GMB pages, and created an FB account and FB pages.  She said she's vetting other vendors for multiple purposes.  Very focused on their e-commerce initiative.  However she realizes launching Chatmeter does not have to wait on the e-commerce initiative.  Said their individual store URL pages will be changing with the e-commerce launch. Told her no prob we would push the update at that time. Sending over F/U's and pricing .  Wants to move in about a month..

***UPDATE*** 4-3-17 
Spoke with Kris - Took the time to explain - She is doing 2 jobs now and launching their e-commerce. Vetting competitors. Call back in May for a revisit of the new dashboard! 
Offer Essentials Listings Management 

***UPDATE 9/1/16** 
Talked to Kris today and they have a scheduled meeting on 9/26 and 9/27 in which they will review. Prior to that Kris is going to champion getting in front of her VP and COO who will ultimately sign off on the contract. I have a call scheduled with her on 9/28 to set up the contract and next steps. 

Agricultural, farm equipment, and supply store 

Kris has been with the company for 20+ years - she does advertising, website information, and listings 

Their listings are a huge mess 


Currently their main priority is upgrading their back end system software which is costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars 

She loves the share feature in the reviews tab to be able to share reviews to store managers 

Listing management is in the road map but is not a huge priority as of now 

They will be able to move on something in October - September is nuts for them right now 

**TT Kris on 9/23 and this is going to be a stretch, offered $1000 off if we can get the ball rolling, hopefully this will get them to move the needle**"

What he cares most about is showing a true relationship between rankings, how they are appearing and how that is impacting the dollars at each location.  Also showed him how he can use the reviews, and compet. comparison to motivate the franchisees to do better, respond.

The call was 30 min and we used the time to walk through the deck and the Starbucks demo.  Her audit was not done.  She does not want to schedule more time to go over her audit - as this rep management and local SEO initiative is ""not on the radar"" for this year.

All others either teach at those brick and mortars or teach at community centers, YMCA, rec centers, church etc.  Only 2 corp owned locations in Oceanside and Carlsbad.  This initiative would be taken up by and paid by corp marketing.  Not doing anything like this right now.  Need to do another audit bc theirs was not done.  They will be sending over 20 locations and want to use the Primary Category: Group Exercise - To pull competitors.  Scheduling out second week in July.  Quoted $25 for CM+LLM.

They're using Yext for LLM and were using them for reviews but said they are phasing our some capabilities (review generation and even for internal) and looking at other alternatives now.  Addressed the Yelp story, etc.  Walked through Sbux demo and she LOVED all the features in Reviews, bulk responding, filtering, etc.. Also thought Pulse was valuable to track employee/service people  names.  They have a meeting with that client next week and wanted a follow up after that.  In the meantime, wanted followups and pricing,  Would not be necessarily white labeling at this time."

They had a question about removing the capabilities to do bulk responding for some users and I have to get back to them about that.They commented they really liked the platform and will be ready to move in the May timeframe. Challenged them on ending the Rep.com contract early. They were not too keen.

7/1/17 Tremaine is the Reputation Digital Manager. Just signed another year contract with Rep.com. Generating reviews, doing surveys is huge for him! It is a very manual and laborious process right now. Did not seem to have an issue with HIPAA. They want to generate more Goole and FB reviews so he loved Review Builder. Listings is not his area but will make an intro to that person - although he knows that they have a contract with their agency for that.. He wants RB pricing only for now and the CM + LLM for future rollouts. $35 for bot. $19 for LLM"

7-26-17 First meeting with Ryan - He has about 45 properties and acquiring 4 more in the next week.  Currently with Respage - they do managed reviews for them as well and has social publishing capabilities.  They were with Rentpath a year ago.  They use another service to send surveys.  We saw a lot of reviews falling through the cracks which really upset him because he's utilizing their managed reviews services.  He also manages the GMP pages, Yelp (the ones he has access to) and the FB pages.  We pulled up dupes in FB. Said it's been taking a while to fix the issues.  He's on month-month with Respage at this point.  Wants deck, pricing and contract, as his legal process can take a month. f/u later this week.  Wants log in credentials."

She was very excited about Chatmeter and all the platform offers. She was adamant about doing the listings herself (which she needs to anyways with 15 locs) and asked if we can provide help docs on that. Looking to make a decision end of this month.

Currently using BirdEye.  Losing the Yelp reviews was not as big of a problem for them as is the inconsistencies and missed reviews. They specifically said the Bird Eye connections are degrading.They use Kingsley Associates surveys that then feed into Satisfacts to push the positive reviews to apartment ratings.  They liked the reporting options on Chatmeter (which is their most important requirement) the rankings and the sharing feature of reviews and media.  They can move off BirdEye as needed so going for a quick close on this one.  Sending over all followups and requested case study."

Wants to remove one property from the audit, and sending over another 5 to add.  Then wants copies of the excel downloads and LBV report.  Meeting with her director later in the week and hopes to have confirmation to move forward in the next 2 weeks.


Good first meeting with Stephanie.  They don't use anything for reviews and MOZ only for listings.  Paying $80/property/year for Moz.  Half their properties are on tax credits and fully leased out 3 years out.  She's also looking at Satisfacts but liked our platform better. They quoted $25/location.  Loved the reviews flexibility and reporting. Wants to use our platform for competition amongst the properties.  Needs to consult with management, Very very price sensitive.  Told me many times they need the least expensive solution.  Rolling out in early Fall. f/u next week."

Kelly is super blunt and transparent. Using a research firm called SMG for reviews and customer insights. Although after digging, looks like they are tracking consumer sentiment based on questionnaires they send them through their system. She is also using a combination of Sprout Social, Sprinklr and Nubi. She was very reserved upfront because she said they are handling reviews internally also doing their Google and listings in Facebook internally. They just signed up for a Yelp account and paying $8 per location per month .She started to be super interested as I continued through the dash and showed the listings. Showed her that even though she thought they were responding to many reviews that barely any were being responded to and of course showed her how easy it is to do so from the dashboard. She told me straight up that they can only do a six-month commitment or pay a lot less because she doesn't have much budget left if any at all. Said she has about 40K for the year. Said I will get back to her and also build a more relevant audit for OH, KY and NC."

They can not commit until they have a client commitment. There sales model doesn't align with ours so it will be more of a difficult sell. They see value but will be hard for them to sell as they don't have a sales team at this point. They charge based on volume of data their software analyses and with reviews the volume is kind of unknown so I don't see this happening any time soon which is the reason for the delayed oppourtunity."

They need Chatmeter!  See general notes below.  This is a grand slam deal BUT she was not jumping out of her chair so I may need to go over her head. 

General: 
80% multifamily, 20% Affordable 
PM’s are responding to reviews pretty regularly
As a company they are doing well managing reviews but with Chatmeter we are going to save them a ton of time! 
Reviews: She is manually auditing bi-weekly the 4 main review sites.  Has 120 links to each site!!  Our tool turns into 4 clicks.  
They are paying an agency for Listings and their listings are shit! 
They are using/paying Solicitfax through Apt finder hence their massive amount of reviews.  
Paid Yelp account. 
Ranks suck and she didn’t see to trust it 
One of the owners of 3 of their properties is using Chatmeter!! He loves it she says and is always pointing out issues for his properties.  
Using Yardi and Entrada PM Software.  

Timing: 
Jan 1 if we can make a deal

Bridge no longer managing Waypoints properties. They separated. Bridge taking over several other. Up to 65 locs and growing. 

Seemed like he either was not blown away and not going to champion or not a decision maker. Going to ""bring it up"" at team meeting. WTF. Using 4-5 tools to manage reviews and a 1 person agency. They are taking over more props and whatever tools they are using at the time. Understands we will put everything under 1 roof!!! 

Right now PM's write out response, send to RPM and Jeff for approval. 

Tools using for different groups of props: 
Social Concierge: Rent.com, gives access to listing pages and supposed to manage and even some review manage. 
1 person Agency: Marketeer: Does some listing and postings on a small scale for a small group of their props. 
Apt Guid: Notification alerts 
Google Alerts 
Some random social media tool that supposedly does some reviews too."

Really sweet.  This is a delayed OPP.  They are kicking the can. 


Demo Notes: 

Needs: 
Ideally new system will be for franchisees to take ownership of Review/Social Mgmt with Corporate oversight 
*Listing Management: Does not want to do listing mgmt. herself
Review Management 
*Posting of Social sites FB, Twitter, Insta

Tools using: Agency: 
Attempting to do listings for them unsuccessfully for FB, Google, Yelp only.  Also monitoring/posting content on FB, Twitter, Insta

Does not have a paid Yelp account

Does not have a budget for this at this time but been here for a year and says this is a mess and feels she has the power to push through.  

Pricing of $50/loc $20/loc (listings) $70/loc = $2,500 a little much but let her know we CAN negotiate

Expressed need for references at some point to make sure not sold bad bill of goods again like with the agency.

2. Add media filters to filter out images that have been posted by internal employees

3. Add specific filters for reporting such as client filters, regional manager filters, and regional VP filters

**OCTOBER UPDATE**

Carolina is currently closing out the month of October with budgeting, they will not decide this month. It is between us, yext, and momentfeed. They agreed they like us more however we need to be strategic from a cost standpoint to make sure one of these guys dont sweep it up from us.

They just launched their new site last week which is a huge weight off the marketing department. This is now a priority.

Decision will be finalized in November, Carolina will sign the agreement as she is the senior director of marketing.

Talked with Jason Saldivar and they are looking to do a pilot on November 14th. Carolina said that our pricing is far outsite of the competitors they are looking at (ReviewTrackers & MomentFeed).

Met w/ Shelley and Carrie - have not rolled out Binary Fountain to all properties yet.  140 total.  Getting Indeed and Glassdoor Review is HUGE for them.  The HR aspect is UBER important.  Shelley said to follow up in 2 months after Binary Fountain rolls out and see if it's crap.  They don't seem to be happy with it so far... May be using MOZ for listings.

Did not see a need for the social tab as he is using Hootsuite, he was looking to see what he really does not need so he can drop the price.

Needs to sell this to Jim Cox his VP - Needs a couple of weeks to do that.  Resend contract with the end of April expiry.  Send ROI for restaurants. Already sent Screenshots, etc. F/U April 21 he said.

Ed Hett is the Director of IT and purchasing

He handles everything from purchasing beef for their food to IT related purchases, issues, etc. He deemed himself the ""gatekeeper"" of the software vendors.

They have used GoLocal and 360 SEO in the past however they are no longer in contract - he is unhappy with their solution after seeing our platforms robust capabilities.

He has several other vendor demos set but he would not share who he was looking at - he did mention one of them was in the realm of $80,000 per year.

He specifically wanted screenshots of Snapshot, Reviews, Listing, ReviewBuilder, and Rankings. When asking him his thoughts and what aspects he could see his company using, he was enthusiastic in his response.

The biggest challenges that they are facing right now is maintaining engagement on social media, so they absolutely loved the built in sharing capabilities.

They are currently using MomentFeed which they like but aren't married to it. They also are using a local SEO company called ""Hibu"" for keyword optimization - which they are not doing a very good job. They weren't sure if they were still in contract with MomentFeed or not.

They currently filter negative responses to customer service who then handles the response. I pointed out that most of them were not responded to because momentfeed uses keyword mentioned to pull the data into their platform. 

Their social media is their strongest point - everything else needs serious improvement.

Hit hard on listings as they had 60+ duplicates for 10 locations, they were all over the place with phone numbers, addresses, and even had location names in the listing itself.

This was a great opportunity for me to educate them on SEO, and there were some significant wow moments especially pertaining to:

1. Review/media sharing
2. ReviewBuilder
3. Integrated SEO rank tracker
4. Listing inaccuracies and how important this was to fix to improve their SEO score.

At the end of the pitch they were ready to kick out their vendors and move forward.. Here is the buying process.

1. John & Jeanine evaluate and recommend options to the Director who has the final decision - it does not need to go any further.

2. Jeanine believes they have allocated this years remaining budget however we have a call scheduled on 9/28 to revisit the discussion."

They outsource a couple of marketing functions to marketing companies. Project Bionic does all their Facebook and Twitter posts.  They just hired a new company, Spence Media Services to handle their Yelp. I mentioned to him the Yelp partnership.  
He loved the dashboard and being able to see all the reviews being pulled in. Said he's never seen anything like that before.  Said this is a timely conversation because they've just started looking at Yelp and all these other sites for lisitngs and reviews.  Asked when they'll take action. If they do it, they do it ""right away"" Asked for the deck, pricing.  Quoted $32 platform and $20 listings management, - He said it seemed like it was in the ballpark.

10-20 Steve emailed the following:  Thanks for the info and the follow up.  I am very interested in the Chatmeter services but will need to hold off for now.  October and November are our very slow months (the rainy season) and as a general rule, we don’t incur additional expenditures in those months.
 Please follow up with me at the end of November or start of December and we can revisit the timing for starting up these services."

Annie responds to each individual review by going through each site

They have had a huge emphasis and focus on social media over the past few months

Annie has been with the company since December of 2015

Has looked at other brand management tools in the past

Annie agreed that Chatmeter is the best solution that she has looked at

She would move forward instantly if she had a way to view and monitor competitor review comments

Talked to Collin and we will add in up to 75 competitors as locations as long as they pay $10 per location, total would be $2000 per month.

**UPDATE** 9/1

TT Annie and she had a demonstration with a competitor in which she will not tell me who it is. They pitched her on 08/31. She said it went ""OK""

The approval process has to go past Annie's boss for the final green light."

**Things needed to move this deal forward**

1. List of what social sites that we will add/support for posting once the review has been completed by the customer. *Sent an email to Collin asking for this list to send to Rav""

2. Timeline/expectations of when we will add an automated email response to the customer that mirrors comments in the case that they do not have the time to post the positive review on their social site at that time.

The solution will be sold through the agency. They would want to white label the solution. They have about 150 locations that would need to be monitored if they do decide to move forward. Rav seems extremely interested in continuing the discussion.

They are using ""Get 5 stars"" for generating reviews

They also use Mauz and Whitespark as well

Scott Allen (VP) owns the budget

66 locations

Meeting set to show Luke the dashboard today

They use Raven Media Marketing as their SEO/agency to help them improve SEO and generate reviews

They are currently working on making all of their franchises consistent from a listing standpoint

Scott Allen loved the platform and is interested

**Update**

Spoke with Luke and he is interested. He wants me to meet with Rav who is the agency that handles responding to reviews.

They started managing listings a year and a half ago but they still have a lot of inaccuracies.

They just started managing reviews in June/July, took over from the franchise owners.

They feel as if they are 10 years behind as far as online reputation is concerned.

Their focus is increasing National Advertising - wants to get into social but it is not a huge focus as of now.

Met with Rav and Matt on 08/10. Need to send over list of sites that will be added to review builder and contract information. Send pricing, documentation, and keys to login so that he can test the software."

**8/22 UPDATE**

Talked to Honor this morning and she showed her VP and the VP loved the platform, however it is way outside of the budget this year. They are currently with NBA and because of pricing they decided to renew their agreement even though they liked our platform better."

Hi Tania,

We ended up moving forward with a different solution that's a vertical market product.  Ultimately didn't have the cool factor that Chat Meter did but was a better fit financially for us.  Thank you so much and happy holidays!

First meeting with the CWS team.  Lisa was referred to us by Tony Wilson, social media manager for Sequoia properties.  They are evaluating rep management now and looking at us vs. Soci, vs. Rep .com and Sprinklr.  Briefed them on the main differences between all of us.  Currently using a vendor (who not tell me whom) that built their websites, it is buggy and don't like it.  It does not integrate with other rep sites and does not properly report.  Their 98 property portfolio is 30% managed and 70% owned.  They LOVED CM + will consider LLM.   Budget approval is mid-December.   25 - 50 - 75 - 100 locations cost breakdown."

Met with both. Both of them were in remote locations (Starbucks) and both were very direct, so a bit challenging. 1400 Locations. Nothing in place for reviews or listings. Rob wanted to cut to the chase and get to pricing while we were still on the review tab. Lee was on the call and helped field questions. Rob wanted to see a proposal, and asked if he can do a 100 store pilot for now. Will send a proposal with list, pre-negotiated pricing and Basic Listing management pricing."

She is very fixated on the publishing tool and content providing of Respage.  Told her she can use Hootsuite for publishing. She wants to look at that again and get back to me.

3-17 Third call with Christina.  Took a bit to process everything walking through the Yelp contract, not resigning with them, the rentpath contract, the provider of SM Media contract.  Spoke about LLM essentials yet ultimately decided to wait on it. Decided to go with all 44 properties - liked the idea she can assign different costs to different properties.  Got a ""let's do this"" verbal. She needs to make sure she has the correct # of props from her accounting - will have that discussion on Monday. Can have it done by Wednesday.

March 8 - Spoke with Christina.  Had some office emergencies - will look at what I sent her and call me back this afternoon.  Nice lady.

- Their growth is both through new store openings and acquisitions

- Budgeting is being outlined for 2017, they are hoping to have numbers before Thanksgiving

- Currently not responding to reviews

Client's are pissed.  
- Must have Sentiment, Competitor analysis, Reviews, and Listings.  They'll have to wait for LLM service, as they have no budget for this right now. 

LOST BUSINESS TO BIRDEYE - DEBRIEF INFO:

Sad but interesting call with my contact at Eat'n Park today in response to my request for a POST LOSS debrief.   She gave me some excellent feedback:   

1)  Who'd we lose to?  Birdeye

2)  Who was in the running for final decision?   She vetted ALL Yelp partners thoroughly, plus Rep.com, Vendasta.   Did not look at Rio SEO.  Final 3 were CM, Birdeye and NBA/Sprinklr (their existing vendor).  

3)  Was price a factor?   No.  She said we are very competitively priced.  In fact, we were the lowest of the three finalists.  (Knowing we were competing against other companies and trying to displace NBA/Sprinklr, I gave very aggressive quote for CM only of just $19/location for 69 locations, and planned to add LLM when more budget was available).  

4)  Primary decision factors:   They had very specific requirements for specific reporting capabilities around sentiment and social media, which we simply don't have yet. Paul Koch and I showed them Chatter and Sentiment in detail, showed which reporting we currently have, and emphasized that they could influence our module enhancement roadmap significantly if they were a client, pretty much getting their specific requests built into platform, if they signed up with us. She said that was a HUGE temptation, but they decided they don't have the time or bandwidth to wait for this extra functionality to be developed and implemented.  So in the end, we're nearly there, but they felt our platform was not QUITE ready for primetime... YET.    

5)  FINAL ANALYSIS:   She said our platform is miles ahead of Rep and Vendasta, and, with the exception of the Sentiment and Social Media analysis and reporting capabilities, we were ahead of Birdeye and Sprinklr too.  However, their primary REQUIREMENT was super robust capabilities in those two areas, so we were edged out for the time being.   For NOW, they've only signed a 6-month contract with Birdeye, and that she wants me to keep her informed of each new enhancement/development we make in the coming months.   She said she clearly sees a scenario where they will switch to CM down the road.

Harmans has 350 KFC locs total.  He was most impressed with the Reviews tab and all the ways I showed him he can massage the data.  We focused on the Spanish Fork store - he chose. Showed him how quickly he can identify operational trends and address them.  He need to present to ""bosses"" and said if this is something they want they can move pretty quick. Warned me they don't add all locations to a platform at once but can start with a sub-set for the annual contract.  Asked if we have any other KFC groups on board.  Sending screenshots and put aside time for Thursday for followup.

Good call with Travis.  Although, the audit was not done and I had to use a different audit for KFC in another state that was not refreshed.. He wanted to check out the platform, regardless.  Said that he's responding to Yelp reviews (they have an account) and stated they can respond to FB *they have a workaround.  Did not want to share his process too much.  Was willing to reschedule so we can audit 20 KFC's in Utah (they own all of them).  Has company-wide contracts to deal with and this is not a ""front burner"" project.   Willing to explore though, and see if it makes sense with benefits and price.  WANTS SENTIMENT AND CHATTER in his audit.

4-17-17 Tania,
 
We are going to go over this on May 4th.
 
Will keep you posted.
 
Thanks

6-2-17 .  First meeting for Tania with Weidner and 11th for Lee.  Went over Pulse, Spent lots of time in Reviews and Listings.  Kristie had lots of specific Q's about reporting and custom reporting requests.  Basically taking our reporting and putting them in pretty graphs and pictures format and also have #'s relating to the percentages.  Colby was massively interested in LLM and LOVED the fact we claim and push listings data to GMB, Yelp and Google at no extra charge.  They pay $59/yr /property.  Making decision in July/Aug.  

Met w/ Brooke - Loved the listings Management cause that's her world. They're using MOZ (that's why their listings look bad) Does not really touch Reputation or Reviews. She LOVED the search feature in reviews and also PULSE pulling out themes. She said that's a piece that Kristie really cares about.. When it comes to specific issues with properties they deal with that together. ** BROOKE came back to ask about Listings again and duplicates! 
We had built the pie chart per Kristie's request: Entrata pilot now. Entrata powers websites, so easier, but she LOVES us. Prop owners. 4yrs deciding on rep from Colby. Use moz, listings suck. SOCI for SM maybe. Loves Comps, Audits, & pricing. $19 for all. Rev Gen/Sentiment HUGE for her. API provisioning"

They use Yext and actually already on our platform via Easy Media. Said they pay a good price, however don't have access to Review Builder. Were very nit-picky about what they don't like about the platform. Most of it is around reporting. They'd like a weekly ""fancy pancy"" Pulse download of distributed topics with the actual reviews on a weekly basis, for example. They also use Google Analytics and Master codes. Want one price for as many properties as they bring on to CM. wehter it's 10 or 80 or 130. F/U tomorrow."

Has been working with them for years. Says he's used ""all platforms"" and knows their weaknesses.  He's worked with Advice Local.  Says he helped build Sweet IQ - uses them for call tracking also.  Used Moment Feed which he said can't keep up.  Yext is probably the most reliable.  He continuously has problems that they can't find duplicates, they don't fine reviews or A revie that has been removed still shows up in the dashboard, Google data does not come in,  Impression data on the back end of Yelp does not come in . Call tracking #'s - they get half their calls and not the other half. Said Keyword rankings are worthless.  Wants to get data from platforms that get trend analysis.  Have about 200 SMB's they'd like to get started with.  Said about 5 times, I just want a stable platform. Understands things go awry but wants to know he has a partner that can catch it and him not bothered with it.  Asked for a ballpark.. paying Yext $18."

Asked about LLM - they said they use an outside partner that helps them with their GMB, FB pages and a ""few others"".  They said they upload into their system the correct info and their system disseminates the info.   Had a few Q's about GMB pages and being able to help them distribute the Google attributes.  Scaleability is a big deal for them - We highlighted all the ways one can scale Chatmeter and also hit on all the major differentiators of our platform.   With 20 min left, they were eager to get to Review Builder and talk about Review Generation since that was such a big part of their RFP.   Went through Media, Pulse and Rankings quickly to get that in - then to RB.  Focused on templates, setup, tracking ,etc.  They asked it they can do A/B testing.

They know the listings is a pain and were horrified by al the unofficial FB pages.   Said they are pretty tapped out with budgets for 2017 because of Yelp.

Internal Local SEO team that is currently spending many man hours manually cleaning up listings.  This could be our in if they were willing to replace them with chatmeter.  

Loved our full suite of product and understood real value.  Quoted agency pricing of $25/Loc/Month (Dashboard), and $20/Loc/Month (LLM) and caveat we can be extremely flexible.  With their current setup, that is still too large of a pricing gap to meet.  That said, was still excited to bring to the boss and explain what is out there.  Maybe they can figure something out.  They also noted they are not in too much pain right now and feel as though they are doing pretty well with their online local rep and listings mgmt."

Brightwistle health got taken over by Influence Health

Influence health has their CRM

Stand - alone buildings in 60 locations 
Not much changes

Physical data - Hundreds of physicians
No way to keep them manually updated.

Script it out of their database and kept to their form field names.

Our template had more field

Tun script from them their side to a .CSV file and WE would do a delta.

Influence Health acquisition - They have a direct VPN to their database and ran with it.

Now where is he going to get data.

Influence Health still has the CMS. They will construct URL for the doctor directory.

CSV file that would come to us,
How do we determine which ones are new and which ones left..

Original CSV file had out SQL broke when the database changed.

Has no SQL script =. Has nothing.

If there’s an API opportunity, to run and get the info to our end.

Add locations, and parameters, and dictate what to add and what to remove. 

We can program into any API’s PH would have.

He would have to go to a vendor that holds their data so they can get API development done. 

Work with our API and perimeter into it.

He would have to pay someone to get the data out.

He would rather have API that would be something non-manual.

>> WE could put together some documentation about the process, give it to them, and they could find out what it would cost for their vendor to build an API.

Eric said the documentation would help.

API - his data source - same company - moving into a more robust system. 

Influence Health does not have API’s.

>> Paul said - shoot them an email, ask for weekly exports from them for now, to get started….A CSV export of their raw data.
Based on flags he has flagged, that will let us know what has changed, what has not… etc…

Get his raw data.  A single excel doc with a single row that has all the data that we need (Our Template)

Xander - Get the hours format 

Needs the hours format from us.
And see on his side who can “script” this for us."

Jenny will most likely want to do a pilot and will want to know what it looks like and cost.  May start with South region, and do it long enough to get to a point of statistical significance. Also Jenny will want to know how we can take over their Yelp and free them of the high cost of keeping that account. and made sure that we're prepared for that.  7.

- Kelly Ahern handles online reputation & social media efforts

- ""Catherine"" was the previous employee that handles digital efforts and is no longer with the company

- Catherine signed up with ReviewTrackers (reputation management) & ""Sim Partners"" for listing management

- This opportunity is scalable from 88 locations that they are currently monitoring to 400-500 if they add in each individual doctor/physician

- Reputation, social media, and local SEO are huge focuses for the company right now

- Their current contract is set to expire in winter/spring

- They signed up with Sim Partners and Review Trackers in March of 2016

- Their listings are a mess

- Kelly had plans to use positive reviews to share on social media so she loved the share feature in the reviews tab

- They are posting regularly on social media

**Next step** 

Meet with Mike and Kelly on November 3rd to further review the platform, left off on the listings tab. Need to show them rankings, workflow, and ReviewBuilder. Plan budget and deployment plan

Concerned about the transition from one vendor to another however I eased their concerns. This seems like this will be the biggest objection however with strategic salesmanship we can win this deal over.

**UPDATE**

Call on 11/4/16 I've identified all of the deal dynamics to move this forward. See call log notes and below.

**** Contract with ReviewTrackers and Sim Partners end Mid December ****

ReviewTrackers charged them $20 per location per month for Review management and Sim Partners tacked on listings for $75 per location.

They originally were going to roll out a pilot with whatever vendor they decided on for 88 corporate locations to start then 300-400 physicians/individual practices within 4-6 weeks. I let them know that they would get a much better rate if they did it all at once and everything was on one contract while also receiving a much better rate.

Pat is the VP of Marketing and Business development and he owns the budget.

It boils down between us and their current vendor who is doing an awful job. They had concerns of switching to a new vendor however I feel like enough urgency was created and value was built to nudge them to make a change.

They have a meeting to discuss who will be monitoring and responding to the individual physicians/practices on November 14th which we should have a total number of locations by that date.

There are very few channels to go through to move this deal forward. Kelly and Mike go right to Pat, Pat owns the budget and signs off on the deal. 

For the onboarding process Kelly would like advice on what will maximize local SEO value when they are building the CSV/Excel file for all of their locations - I told her I would be more than happy to coach her."

- Local SEO is not a huge focus as they primarily dominate google search rankings both organically and locally. Used bing as a pain point and FaceBook when they launch their local listing search engine.

- The bulk of their traffic is driven from their traditional site, they sell a lot of movie tickets online

- Andrei thinks it would be a good idea to expose their community manager and customer service manager to our platform late in Q1 early Q2.

Met during Social Media Marketing World 2018... Kyle started emailing Troy Mar 27 and set up initial call with Chris VanLiew. Chris went abroad and communication went dark for approx 2 weeks. After Chris Resigned, Kyle and I reached out Jun 12 and picked up the conversation. 

At one point Troy had emailed Chris asking how he could get the same results as Calfit- fwd email from Michelle praising us. 

Number of pitches throughout sales cycle
 Chris VL demo'd 1x Mar 28. 

I demo'd with retention team which was recorded and sent to other team members so they could be looped in. Second ""quick demo Q&A"" with Troy a week later. 

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker
Troy Wise- Marketing Director (champ)
Willy Banos COO  (DM)

Favorite Chatmeter products
Loved that everything is in one place, especially like Reviews and Pulse 

State if the contact ever went dark, how long, and how they came back (BDR got them back on, requested a demo)
Went dark for 2-3 weeks while Chris was abroad..... Went dark on me several times for 3days/week each time. Would always resurface by CCing me on an email to his boss 

Any marketing content downloads (case study, downloads, webinars, etc.)
No Downloads- did Sendoso Troy a neck pillow because he travels between Texas and LA sometimes 2x a week and everyone loves a good neck pillow



Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close 
Tracy joined retention team demo- was super helpful 

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract
Yes- communication was sparse while Troy worked to get approval

Length of sales cycle
4mo 

Competitors won against

Molly pitched Michael Crowder and followed up for the next few weeks while they were vetting other platforms. Brianna came back and asked for lower pricing matching what was quoted a couple of years back. When they got push back, they asked for a pilot. Went dark for a couple of weeks and came back to say we lost to Sweet IQ. Never did tell us why (as far as I can see in the notes). 

How they heard about us - Outreach

Number of pitches throughout sales cycle - Six

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker - Brianna Wynn - Digital Project Manager - Reputation Management

Favorite Chatmeter products - Platform + Local Listings Managemenr

State if the contact ever went dark, how long, and how they came back (BDR got them back on, requested a demo) 
They went dark a few different times before I pitched them in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Scott started outreach again in the fall of 2018 and Chris picked it up in 2019 and stayed on top of Brianna until she booked a meeting with him in March.

Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close (Tracy or Michael to discuss onboarding, Marketing did an ROI report, Any member of the exec team) - No

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract - Yes. They asked for termination for convenience (we had to negotiate that out), asked for extra language around LLM and to state the specific directories we cover and time to go live. Also asked for SLA around downtime notification.

Length of sales cycle - 5 years total

They are currently using Apartment SEO. .She told me while at the Liynd company she was using Easy Media and asked me if we are the same company.  She also said that although Easy Media is using Chatmeter's platform they also had a workflow mechanism that she was utilizing.  She is ready to move on from Apartment SEO today - However it is crucial that the Chatmeter workflow is live today.  I let her know I will get back to her on the official launch date - she offered to be a Beta user.  She also has to have responding to Apartments.com in the dashboard and said apartment ratings is nice but understands have we will not have that.  We talked about pricing and for 150 properties properties we are right in the ballpark of where we need to be with her so at this point we need workflow to be live and she will move ASAP."

Enterprise owns Enterprise - 7,200 locations, Alamo - 250+ locations and National - 2,000+ locations.  They are using YEXT for all their listings and also using reputation.com for reviews. They said more than a couple of times that they are very happy with what they are using right now and they are checking us out because John McDonald takes three cold calls per week and decided to hear us out. Of course I went through our differentiators and stressed the Yelp partnership that reputation does not have they were aware of that and didn't seem to mind. They really liked the media tab because they don’t have anything like that right now. They said in terms of sentiment it's not a big deal for them since they have a whole team that does that internally. I challenged them on that and said I will be checking in with them because of this is always changing.. All in all it was a pretty good call given the circumstance and we're open for us to connect with them periodically."

She’s gathering information right now to present to her boss, Kevin - whom I presented to last year.  She just put in her 2 weeks’ notice.  So this project may get delayed based on how ling it will take to find her replacement.  Also needs listings management for two other brands: Williams oil and Williams Lubricants.  Total of 66 locations.  Asked her where we need to be to be in the ballpark based on the quotes she got from the other two companies.  Quoted $30 total for LLM + CM.  Follow up in a week to see where they’re at."

Corporate owns all the access to their Google my business pages Facebook pages  and also Yelp.  Typical franchisee set up.  He is most concerned about Yelp since they get a lot of reviews there and also images - however I pointed out to him that Google gets the lions share of their reviews. I brought up the Google changes and the Q and A now appearing on their pages which concerned him.  It's still going to be an uphill battle to sell this internally although I think we are getting closer now with the media tab and sentiment and the fact that they can still respond to reviews on Facebook with their franchisee handle.  Pointed out they can also respond to the Q&A with a Google account.  Sending followups and regrouping in a month."

Went to some open questions they had since our last meeting specifically around direct messaging access on our social and also wanted to verify all of the review sites that were collecting information from. They sent over an NDA and a few other vendor forms to get started in completing those. they already warned me their contract process takes a while since they're a bank and there is a lot of red tape to get through.They were also frank and told me that we are up against Sweet IQ and Sweet IQ pricing is $30,000 less per year than ours. They did admit that it's not 100percent apples to apples and asked if we can meet the Sweet IQ pricing.  Because they can't justify the $30K extra spend.


Nikki came over to us from PODS where she was using Chatmeter.  256 locations.  They don't have an LLM product in place.  Reviews are all manual.  nothing really in place for that now.  They know they have 40 GMB pages that they need to take control over - and also are doing a major re-brand to >>> Bank OZK,  on July 16.  They have vetted other vendors but did not tell me whom.  They did share they are very impressed with Chatmeter.   A big ASK is to be able to run a job, from their end to look for modified changes in their listings then their API will push the updated info to their Web URL.  They're sending over all the security information docs need to be completed,  Folowup meeting on the 10th."
