Met during Social Media Marketing World 2018... Kyle started emailing Troy Mar 27 and set up initial call with Chris VanLiew. Chris went abroad and communication went dark for approx 2 weeks. After Chris Resigned, Kyle and I reached out Jun 12 and picked up the conversation. 

At one point Troy had emailed Chris asking how he could get the same results as Calfit- fwd email from Michelle praising us. 

Number of pitches throughout sales cycle
 Chris VL demo'd 1x Mar 28. 

I demo'd with retention team which was recorded and sent to other team members so they could be looped in. Second ""quick demo Q&A"" with Troy a week later. 

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker
Troy Wise- Marketing Director (champ)
Willy Banos COO  (DM)

Favorite Chatmeter products
Loved that everything is in one place, especially like Reviews and Pulse 

State if the contact ever went dark, how long, and how they came back (BDR got them back on, requested a demo)
Went dark for 2-3 weeks while Chris was abroad..... Went dark on me several times for 3days/week each time. Would always resurface by CCing me on an email to his boss 

Any marketing content downloads (case study, downloads, webinars, etc.)
No Downloads- did Sendoso Troy a neck pillow because he travels between Texas and LA sometimes 2x a week and everyone loves a good neck pillow



Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close 
Tracy joined retention team demo- was super helpful 

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract
Yes- communication was sparse while Troy worked to get approval

Length of sales cycle

Meetings occurred with Brianna Wynn (my main POC) 2/2016 and 3/2016. Lee met with Brianna 7/2016. Then it fell off radar. Michael Crowder reached back out to Lee 7/2017 and was passed to Molly. Molly pitched Michael Crowder and followed up for the next few weeks while they were vetting other platforms. Brianna came back and asked for lower pricing matching what was quoted a couple of years back. When they got push back, they asked for a pilot. Went dark for a couple of weeks and came back to say we lost to Sweet IQ. Never did tell us why (as far as I can see in the notes). 

How they heard about us - Outreach

Number of pitches throughout sales cycle - Six

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker - Brianna Wynn - Digital Project Manager - Reputation Management

Favorite Chatmeter products - Platform + Local Listings Managemenr

State if the contact ever went dark, how long, and how they came back (BDR got them back on, requested a demo) 
They went dark a few different times before I pitched them in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Scott started outreach again in the fall of 2018 and Chris picked it up in 2019 and stayed on top of Brianna until she booked a meeting with him in March.

Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close (Tracy or Michael to discuss onboarding, Marketing did an ROI report, Any member of the exec team) - No

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract - Yes. They asked for termination for convenience (we had to negotiate that out), asked for extra language around LLM and to state the specific directories we cover and time to go live. Also asked for SLA around downtime notification.

Length of sales cycle - 5 years total

They were unhappy with Sweet IQ and came back to us - and we blew them away :)","4158"

The summer is going great! 

I'm sorry to push this off, but we're currently handling a large priority with a recent business development deal that was signed. I don't think we're going to have the time to consider a change to Chatmeter for at least another quarter or so. 

I appreciate you following up, and I think we can definitely connect again in the future when and if this becomes more of a priority.

Thanks,
Jason","1000"

This opportunity all started back in August 2018 with a referral from YELP and that we were their number one recommendation. The first initial discussion was with Meredith Willets who was their marketing manager and she brought Angie Wiendlant into the conversation who is the director of marketing - We took her and the entire team through the platform - it was pretty clear that they had no control over their reputation or listings management - they had less than 1% review response rate and listings were pretty good because they are using YEXT but they weren't happy with customer service - they were greatly impressed by review responding / sentiment / and our approach to LLM - After that initial demo with the team this is when things started to south - the LAF team went completely dark for 3 months and I was finally able to reconnect with them in November - since then they started to talk to MomentFeed and Brandify - they didn't know who to choose so suggested let put together an ROI study to show them the potential of what they are missing out on - taking them through the ROI study really showed them that there were missing out on a huge revenue stream - they saw great value in it and after that went completely dark again - they said they had other priorities comes and this was going to be put on hold..... fast forward to February when Justin started - we threw out a promotion and LAF responded - we did a quick refresher of the platform and were just about to finalize when another wrench was thrown into the mix - que Brenda Underwood who was the new person promoted to handle all reputation - she was now going to be a major influencer - we demoed her on the spot and she was quite impressed with the platform - from here we extended the promotion a week but LAF fell back into the old pattern and went completely dark for another 3 months - they occasionally popped their head up to give us an update but communication was non-exist","10295"

Entire LIFECYCLE: Jonathan started reaching out to Jerard Phillips Cate and Hancock back in April for a HMPS in Utah in 2018. They are a healthcare marketing agency and I finally met with them in May 2018. We continued to stay in touch and had a follow up meeting in July where they told me that they are looking at Chatmeter for one of their clients Mount Nittany Health.   
I knew they were pitching that healthcare system and they were selling them on using a platform that is calculating all time star ratings and reviews. Had a couple of followup meetings - They then went dark in the November timeframe. 
January 2019 - Kira from Mount Nittany reached out to me to ask to get a demo of Chatmeter for her and for her coworkers. I pitched them in January 2019 and sent over all of the follow ups. They said they had to make sure they had budget for it and finally in March they said they were going to move forward. I sent them the service agreement in March where it took over two months for it to go through internal executive meetings, approvals & more meetings. 
Throughout all this I consistently stayed on top of Kira to ensure that this continues to move forward and finally closed end of May.

I hope all is well. I see that you left a voicemail wanting to discuss with us about where Chatmeter fell short since we decided to go with another provider. 

We simply made a decision that the provider we went with (and we prefer to keep that private) is best suited our business model needs.

Please do not take this as a sign that Chatmeter is a failure or has fallen short. It has obviously established over a decade of good reputation and location management service. Our key reason for going with another platform has to do with its capability to allow us to meet our clients' customized needs. 

Having complete control of the distribution of information rather than handing it to a third party service to manage is a must for our business model. 

However, I wish you the best with future businesses that could benefit from a service that removes the burden and complexity of online reputation management, simplifies workflow, and allows them to focus on the main operations of their business. 

Have a great day.","2220"

Reached out to Tony DiNicola in April 2018 - Was not ready at the time to talk about a project and wanted to reconvene in the New Year - At that time, the project was for 3500-5000 dealers. 
In August, got connected withMet with Tina Saghafi. She had taken the project over from Tony. Putting together a package to add to their platform. One where they are aggregating reviews for all of their dealership customers primarily on Google Facebook and Yelp. She wanted to just get the review data, the scoring the average rating.
- How they heard about us:
Lee connected with them through their parent - Cox Automotive.
- Number of pitches throughout sales cycle
5 pitches by Tania - Last pitch was at their offices in Irvine - Lee and I went up to pitch Tina's boss, Juan Flores, in April 2019

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker
Tina Saghafi - Project Director
Juan Flores - Senior Director
- Favorite Chatmeter products
All in one dash for rep management and API access
- Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract
Final stages of contract negotiation, the COX Automotive supply chain contact reached out to consolidate our other contracts with Cox companies which potentially would have negatively impacted previously negotiated pricing.  Lee put together a presentation that identifies how which one of our contracts with Cox is completely different and avoided this negative impact on other contracts.
- Help from other departments - Cynthia put together a great ROI spreadsheet and calculator for KBB identifying the positive impact on average time someone spends on the KBB Site and other KPI's.   Lee was super helpful in the final negotiation stages as well as in face-to-face meetings, leveraging his knowledge of working with Cox.

Was a referral from McCormack Baron, Jenny Rice Bielweicz. 
- First got the lead from Jenny back in February. Thanks for passing that over Jared & Lee!

Scheduled our first demo with Malaika Taylor (Champion) on 3/1/2019.
- They were not working with any other partners

Budget: 
- There was no budget set for this account
- Was hesitant at the $1,000 minimum
- Thought they could rally enough properties to get behind the technology

Location Count: 
- Has a total of 63 properties. I provided 3 recorded demo's of our dashboard, and those recordings were sent to the whole group. 39 properties individually chose to sign up with the platform on the first round! We will soon get the rest of the 24 properties to fall in line. 

Favorite Chatmeter feature:
- Client needed a way to manage positive and negative reviews in a single platform
- Monitor Media - They LOVED this tab! Liked that they could create an internal directory of positive images to share and flag negative ones to make the mangers in the region aware of bad behavior and images on their property locations.   
- Listing Management - They do NOT have their Google My Business Pages claimed, and need Chatmeter to do that. 
- Social Publishing - Loved the idea of creating Facebook posts and publish to multiple Facebook pages at once.

The client did go dark for about 2-months. Multiple emails & phone calls. I thought the deal was dead... Until I got an email from my Champion, Malaika Taylor (not the signer) that they were ready to move forward and for me to send them pricing. Maybe they looked at other vendors and still decided they liked Chatmeter the most :) 

They purchased our full portfolio for list-price. $77 / location for 39-locations = $3,135.

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract
Yes, we included a 30-day termination for convenience (approved by Lee)

Contract was sent & signed the next day.","3135"

Mau had been reaching out for a while and finally got them to jump on a call with Tania back in April/May after multiple reschedules and cancellations. They went dark on Tania afterwards and then came back around this summer. Budget didn’t allow them to squeeze this in this year. After a political article came out in August, they had a ton of reviews flowing in and couldn’t handle responding to them. Mau got back in touch and we scheduled a quick call to reconnect, discuss new products and pricing. Gave them a deadline to make a decision within a few days in order to honor prior pricing proposed and we got signatures in 4 days.

Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close :
Mau helped push this along consistently after they’ve cancelled, rescheduled, and went dark several times. Justin jumped on a pricing negotiation call with me to bring credibility to setting a deadline, which was very helpful. 

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract
Had to present to CEO, who was out of town, but we were very strict on the pricing expiration date .They weren’t answering emails, calls or texts until 2 hours before deadline, when Rob called me and apologized for the delay. They are very excited to partner!

•	How they heard about us : Brett Mahoney reaching out via email 
•	Number of pitches throughout sales cycle - I originally met with tracey on July 10th. She was running late to our meeting so we were short on time. She rushed me through the demo and wasn’t giving me much information on their current process with yext. She basically wanted to see what we had to offer without providing information . After our initial conversation we had 2 phone follow up calls to discuss price. We then negotiated on one call afterwards , in which Lee helped seal the deal. A handful of emails inbetween, but overall this was a 2 week sales process due to their yext contract ending.

Used our listings collateral and Chatmeter vs. Yext deck to speak to problems with syndication and suppression with Yest. 
Also, we ran out of Starbucks coffee cards, so I used sendoso to send Robin a gift card right after the conference to get back on the line. And keep our momentum going.

Fastest medical contract review I have ever had. They are a different kind of provider, so they didn't have a much red tape.

We have decided to select another company for our local listings and review management partner.  I appreciate the information you have provided and the work that was put into your sales effort.  It was not an easy decision, as Chatmeter has many good benefits to consider.   I will keep you in mind if our path changes.

Titles of Champion and Decision Maker
Champion and Signer- Kimberly Cleirbaut
DM: CEO: Nkere Udofia (never spoke with him) 

Favorite Chatmeter products:
All in one dash, responding to reviews and our reporting.

Did The Prospect Go Dark? 
Never went dark, but after the deal went into redlines the CEO and marketing team told Kim that the pricing we had agreed on (for all products) was too high, so we had to restrategize and cut products

Any marketing content downloads (case study, downloads, webinars, etc.)
Participation from other Chatmeter departments that assisted in the close (Tracy or Michael to discuss onboarding, Marketing did an ROI report, Any member of the exec team):

Any hurdles the contact had to overcome on their side to sign the contract:
During Redlines, the CEO asked Kim to evaluate other companies and look for lesser pricing- I was able to run a quick interference and provide her with some insight on competitors, etc as well as re-evaluate product offering/pricing for them
